Subject: [PATCH] ARM: BCM5301X: Enable SPI-NOR on dual flash devices
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Commit 1b47b98acce2 ("ARM: BCM5301X: Add DT entry for SPI controller and
NOR flash") enabled SPI-NOR device on routers using serial flash only.
However there are also devices with two flash memories:
1) Small SPI attached flash used mostly for booting
2) Bigger NAND used mostly for storing firmware
On such devices we still need SPI-NOR e.g. to access NVRAM data.
