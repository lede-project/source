This target is intended for ARM machines that use UEFI to boot, this includes
ARM datacenter machines and some smaller embedded boards with EDK2 or u-boot.

ARM server machines are different from most ARM machines up to now as they use
ACPI as their hardware description mechanism, instead of device tree.
Hence the bootup experience on these systems is very similar to a modern
x86-64 machine.

A related specification is the ARM Embedded Base Boot requirements, which
provides more latitude for embedded boards, which may use device tree or
ACPI, but must provide a useful set of EFI Services (Startup, Shutdown,
RTC etc.).

Machines with u-boot's bootefi command can also use this target, in this case
the bootloader supplies a device tree blob as well as providing a subset
of EFI services.

Any preinit scripts in this target should be mindful that a system could use
either ACPI or device tree.

machines:

Note: The EFI partition must be formatted as FAT32, which has a minimum
size based on the sector size. To ensure the partition is correctly formatted,
CONFIG_TARGET_KERNEL_PARTSIZE is set to 48MB, well above the minimum size for 
512-sector disks.

QEMU can be used to emulate an ARM server board with UEFI, for example:
sudo qemu-system-aarch64 -m 128 -cpu cortex-a57 -M virt -nographic -bios "QEMU_EFI.fd" \
	-drive if=none,file=openwrt-armserver-64-combined-ext4.img,id=hd0  -serial tcp::4446,server,telnet -monitor stdio \
	-device virtio-blk-device,drive=hd0
