Subject: [PATCH] net: phy: fix marvell phy status reading

The Marvell driver incorrectly provides phydev->lp_advertising as the
logical and of the link partner's advert and our advert.  This is
incorrect - this field is supposed to store the link parter's unmodified
advertisment.

This allows ethtool to report the correct link partner auto-negotiation
status.
