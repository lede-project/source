Subject: bridge: allow receiption on disabled port

When an ethernet device is enslaved to a bridge, and the bridge STP
detects loss of carrier (or operational state down), then normally
packet receiption is blocked.

This breaks control applications like WPA which maybe expecting to
receive packets to negotiate to bring link up. The bridge needs to
block forwarding packets from these disabled ports, but there is no
hard requirement to not allow local packet delivery.
