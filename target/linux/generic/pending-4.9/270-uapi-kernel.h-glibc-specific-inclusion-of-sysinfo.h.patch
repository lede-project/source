Subject: uapi/kernel.h: glibc specific inclusion of sysinfo.h

including sysinfo.h from kernel.h makes no sense whatsoever,
but removing it breaks glibc's userspace header,
which includes kernel.h instead of sysinfo.h from their sys/sysinfo.h.
this seems to be a historical mistake.
on musl, including any header that uses kernel.h directly or indirectly
plus sys/sysinfo.h will produce a compile error due to redefinition of
struct sysinfo from sys/sysinfo.h.
so for now, only include it on glibc or when including from kernel
in order not to break their headers.
