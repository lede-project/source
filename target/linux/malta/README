This Malta target is intended to be used with the Qemu emulator. It can be used
to prototype an LEDE firmware for MIPS processors. One could also use it to
troubleshoot MIPS applications without access to real hardware.

To use the images built by LEDE with qemu, use the following commands:

For the little-endian image:
qemu-system-mipsel -kernel bin/malta/lede-malta-le-vmlinux-initramfs.elf -nographic -m 256

For the big-endian image:
qemu-system-mips -kernel bin/malta/lede-malta-be-vmlinux-initramfs.elf -nographic -m 256

and enjoy the system bootin.
