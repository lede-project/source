 Info:   Switch Pi3 Bluetooth function to use the mini-UART (ttyS0) and restore
         UART0/ttyAMA0 over GPIOs 14 & 15. Note that this may reduce the maximum
         usable baudrate.

    If cmdline.txt uses the alias serial0 to refer to the user-accessable port
    then the firmware will replace with the appropriate port whether or not
