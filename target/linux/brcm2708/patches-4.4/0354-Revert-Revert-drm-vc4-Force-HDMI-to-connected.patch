Subject: [PATCH] Revert "Revert "drm/vc4: Force HDMI to connected.""

This reverts commit 7da44d06540b4a191ecc74e943f3203577fce0df.

This breaks the driver on Pi3 as hotplug is implemented through a
gpio expander owned by the GPU.

We need to extend the virtual gpio driver to support this, but for
now assume hotplug is always enabled.
