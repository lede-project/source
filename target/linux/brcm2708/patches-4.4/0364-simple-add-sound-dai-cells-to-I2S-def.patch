Subject: [PATCH 364/381] simple: add sound-dai-cells to I2S def

Add '#sound-dai-cells = <0>;' to the I2S definition in
bcm2708_common.dtsi

Not having it specified, whilst not causing an issue right now with
rpi-4.4.y, is going to cause an issue going forward with the use of
simple-card driver. So it doesn't fall through the cracks, patch it
in now.

Hopefully Martin has taken care of getting a patch submitted for the
upstream Pi dts, as it was he who first run into the issue with the
current upstream kernel....
