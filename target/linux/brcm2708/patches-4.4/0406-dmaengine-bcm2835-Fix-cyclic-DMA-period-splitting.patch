Subject: [PATCH 406/423] dmaengine: bcm2835: Fix cyclic DMA period splitting

The code responsible for splitting periods into chunks that
can be handled by the DMA controller missed to update total_len,
the number of bytes processed in the current period, when there
are more chunks to follow.

Therefore total_len was stuck at 0 and the code didn't work at all.
This resulted in a wrong control block layout and audio issues because
the cyclic DMA callback wasn't executing on period boundaries.

Fix this by adding the missing total_len update.
