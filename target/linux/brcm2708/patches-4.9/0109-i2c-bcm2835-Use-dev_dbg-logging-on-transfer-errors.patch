Subject: [PATCH] i2c: bcm2835: Use dev_dbg logging on transfer errors
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Writing to an AT24C32 generates on average 2x i2c transfer errors per
32-byte page write. Which amounts to a lot for a 4k write. This is due
to the fact that the chip doesn't respond during it's internal write
cycle when the at24 driver tries and retries the next write.
Only a handful drivers use dev_err() on transfer error, so switch to
dev_dbg() instead.
