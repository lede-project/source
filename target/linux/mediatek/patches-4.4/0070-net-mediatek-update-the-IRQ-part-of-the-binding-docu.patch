Subject: [PATCH 070/102] net: mediatek: update the IRQ part of the binding
 document

The current binding document only describes a single interrupt. Update the
document by adding the 2 other interrupts.

The driver currently only uses a single interrupt. The HW is however able
to using IRQ grouping to split TX and RX onto separate GIC irqs.
