Subject: [PATCH 088/102] net-next: mediatek: fix threshold value
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The logic to calculate the threshold value for stopping the TX queue is
bad. Currently it will always use 1/2 of the rings size, which is way too
much. Set the threshold to MAX_SKB_FRAGS. This makes sure that the queue
is stopped when there is not enough room to accept an additional segment.Â
