+Mediatek PCIe controller
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible: Should be one of:
+	- "mediatek,mt2701-pcie"
+	- "mediatek,mt7623-pcie"
+- device_type: Must be "pci"
+- reg: A list of physical base address and length for each set of controller
+  registers. A list of register ranges to use. Must contain an
+    entry for each entry in the reg-names property.
+- reg-names: Must include the following entries:
+  "pcie": PCIe registers
+  "pcie phy0": PCIe PHY0 registers
+  "pcie phy1": PCIe PHY0 registers
+  "pcie phy2": PCIe PHY0 registers
+- interrupts: A list of interrupt outputs of the controller. Must contain an
+  entry for each entry in the interrupt-names property.
+- interrupt-names: Must include the following entries:
+  "pcie0": The interrupt that is asserted for port0
+  "pcie1": The interrupt that is asserted for port1
+  "pcie2": The interrupt that is asserted for port2
+- bus-range: Range of bus numbers associated with this controller
+- #address-cells: Address representation for root ports (must be 3)
+- #size-cells: Size representation for root ports (must be 2)
+- ranges: Describes the translation of addresses for root ports and standard
+  PCI regions. The entries must be 6 cells each.
+  Please refer to the standard PCI bus binding document for a more detailed
+  explanation.
+- #interrupt-cells: Size representation for interrupts (must be 1)
+- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
+  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
+- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
+  - pcie0
+  - pcie1
+  - pcie2
+- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in reset-names.
+  See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
+- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
+  - pcie0
+  - pcie1
+  - pcie2
+- mediatek,hifsys: Must contain a phandle to the HIFSYS syscon range.
+Root ports are defined as subnodes of the PCIe controller node.
+
+Required properties:
+- device_type: Must be "pci"
+- assigned-addresses: Address and size of the port configuration registers
+- reg: PCI bus address of the root port
+- #address-cells: Must be 3
+- #size-cells: Must be 2
+- ranges: Sub-ranges distributed from the PCIe controller node. An empty
+  property is sufficient.
