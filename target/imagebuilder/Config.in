	  This is essentially a stripped-down version of the buildroot
	  with precompiled packages, kernel image and image building tools.
	  You can use it to generate custom images without compiling anything

config IB_STANDALONE

	default y
	depends on IB
	help
	  Disabling this option will cause the ImageBuilder to embed only
	  toolchain and kmod packages while all other ipk archives will be
	  fetched from online repositories.
