    gcc: don't clobber stamp-bits with a symlink to itself
    
    Several versions of gcc have an issue in libstdc++v3 where the build may
    clobber stamp-bits with a link to itself.  This doesn't manifest itself
    on all systems.  On several Ubuntu systems, this doesn't appear to be a
    problem, but it is an issue on Fedora 16 systems.
    
    To fix the issue, we'll simply filter out stamp-bits from the symlinks
    to be generated.
    
    Note: gcc 4.4.7 is unaffected by this issue, so no fix is necessary
    there.
