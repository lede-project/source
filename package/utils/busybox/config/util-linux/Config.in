	  "obexfs -b00.11.22.33.44.55 /mnt"
	  Also "mount -t sometype [-o opts] fs /mnt" will try
	  "sometype [-o opts] fs /mnt" if simple mount syscall fails.
	  The idea is to use such virtual filesystems in /etc/fstab.

	  acpid listens to ACPI events coming either in textual form from
	  /proc/acpi/event (though it is marked deprecated it is still widely
	  used and _is_ a standard) or in binary form from specified evdevs
	  (just use /dev/input/event*).

	  It parses the event to retrieve ACTION and a possible PARAMETER.
	  It then spawns /etc/acpi/<ACTION>[/<PARAMETER>] either via run-parts
	  (if the resulting path is a directory) or directly as an executable.

	  N.B. acpid relies on run-parts so have the latter installed.

	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	  fdflush is only needed when changing media on slightly-broken
	  removable media drives. It is used to make Linux believe that a
	  hardware disk-change switch has been actuated, which causes Linux to
	  forget anything it has cached from the previous media. If you have
	  such a slightly-broken drive, you will need to run fdflush every time
	  you change a disk. Most people have working hardware and can safely
	  leave this disabled.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FDFORMAT

	  sized page at a time. If you want to read text that is larger than
	  the screen, and you are using anything faster than a 300 baud modem,
	  you will probably find this utility very helpful. If you don't have
	  any need to reading text files, you can leave this disabled.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PIVOT_ROOT
	bool "pivot_root"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_PIVOT_ROOT
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	  The pivot_root utility swaps the mount points for the root filesystem
	  with some other mounted filesystem. This allows you to do all sorts
	  of wild and crazy things with your Linux system and is far more
	  powerful than 'chroot'.

	  Note: This is for initrd in linux 2.4. Under initramfs (introduced
	  in linux 2.6) use switch_root instead.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_RDATE
	bool "rdate"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_RDATE
	help
	  The rdate utility allows you to synchronize the date and time of your
	  system clock with the date and time of a remote networked system using
	  the RFC868 protocol, which is built into the inetd daemon on most
	  systems.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_RDEV

	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_RDEV
	help
	  Print the device node associated with the filesystem mounted at '/'.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_READPROFILE

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SWAPONOFF
	bool "swaponoff"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_SWAPONOFF
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	  This option enables both the 'swapon' and the 'swapoff' utilities.
	  Once you have created some swap space using 'mkswap', you also need
	  to enable your swap space with the 'swapon' utility. The 'swapoff'
	  utility is used, typically at system shutdown, to disable any swap
	  space. If you are not using any swap space, you can leave this
	  option disabled.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SWAPON_DISCARD
	bool "Support discard option -d"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SWAPON_DISCARD
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SWAPONOFF
	help
	  Enable support for discarding swap area blocks at swapon and/or as
	  the kernel frees them. This option enables both the -d option on
	  'swapon' and the 'discard' option for swap entries in /etc/fstab.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SWAPON_PRI
	bool "Support priority option -p"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SWAPON_PRI
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SWAPONOFF

	  Enable support for setting swap device priority in swapon.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SWITCH_ROOT
	bool "switch_root"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_SWITCH_ROOT
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	  The switch_root utility is used from initramfs to select a new
	  root device. Under initramfs, you have to use this instead of
	  pivot_root. (Stop reading here if you don't care why.)

	  Booting with initramfs extracts a gzipped cpio archive into rootfs
	  (which is a variant of ramfs/tmpfs). Because rootfs can't be moved
	  or unmounted*, pivot_root will not work from initramfs. Instead,
	  switch_root deletes everything out of rootfs (including itself),
	  does a mount --move that overmounts rootfs with the new root, and
	  then execs the specified init program.

	  * Because the Linux kernel uses rootfs internally as the starting
	  and ending point for searching through the kernel's doubly linked
	  list of active mount points. That's why.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UMOUNT
	bool "umount"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_UMOUNT
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	  When you want to remove a mounted filesystem from its current mount
	  point, for example when you are shutting down the system, the
	  'umount' utility is the tool to use. If you enabled the 'mount'
	  utility, you almost certainly also want to enable 'umount'.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_UMOUNT_ALL
	bool "Support option -a"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_UMOUNT_ALL
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UMOUNT

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_MOUNT_LOOP
	bool "Support loopback mounts"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_MOUNT_LOOP
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_MOUNT || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UMOUNT
	help
	  Enabling this feature allows automatic mounting of files (containing
	  filesystem images) via the linux kernel's loopback devices.
	  The mount command will detect you are trying to mount a file instead
	  of a block device, and transparently associate the file with a
	  loopback device. The umount command will also free that loopback
	  device.

	  You can still use the 'losetup' utility (to manually associate files
	  with loop devices) if you need to do something advanced, such as
	  specify an offset or cryptographic options to the loopback device.
	  (If you don't want umount to free the loop device, use "umount -D".)

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_MOUNT_LOOP_CREATE
	bool "Create new loopback devices if needed"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_MOUNT_LOOP_CREATE
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_MOUNT_LOOP
	help
	  Linux kernels >= 2.6.24 support unlimited loopback devices. They are
	  allocated for use when trying to use a loop device. The loop device
	  must however exist.

	  This feature lets mount to try to create next /dev/loopN device
	  if it does not find a free one.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_MTAB_SUPPORT
	bool "Support for the old /etc/mtab file"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_MTAB_SUPPORT
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_MOUNT || BUSYBOX_CONFIG_UMOUNT
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_MOUNT_FAKE
	help
	  Historically, Unix systems kept track of the currently mounted
	  partitions in the file "/etc/mtab". These days, the kernel exports
	  the list of currently mounted partitions in "/proc/mounts", rendering
	  the old mtab file obsolete. (In modern systems, /etc/mtab should be
	  a symlink to /proc/mounts.)

	  The only reason to have mount maintain an /etc/mtab file itself is if
	  your stripped-down embedded system does not have a /proc directory.
	  If you must use this, keep in mind it's inherently brittle (for
	  example a mount under chroot won't update it), can't handle modern
	  features like separate per-process filesystem namespaces, requires
	  that your /etc directory be writable, tends to get easily confused
	  by --bind or --move mounts, won't update if you rename a directory
	  that contains a mount point, and so on. (In brief: avoid.)

	  About the only reason to use this is if you've removed /proc from
	  your kernel.
