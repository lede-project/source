menu "Busybox Settings"

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_DESKTOP
	bool "Enable options for full-blown desktop systems"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_DESKTOP
	help
	  Enable options and features which are not essential.
	  Select this if you plan to use busybox on full-blown desktop machine
	  with common Linux distro, which needs higher level of command-line
	  compatibility.

	  If you are preparing your build to be used on an embedded box
	  where you have tighter control over the entire set of userspace
	  tools, you can unselect this option for smaller code size.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_EXTRA_COMPAT
	bool "Provide compatible behavior for rare corner cases (bigger code)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_EXTRA_COMPAT
	help
	  This option makes grep, sed etc handle rare corner cases
	  (embedded NUL bytes and such). This makes code bigger and uses
	  some GNU extensions in libc. You probably only need this option
	  if you plan to run busybox on desktop.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_INCLUDE_SUSv2
	bool "Enable obsolete features removed before SUSv3"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_INCLUDE_SUSv2
	help
	  This option will enable backwards compatibility with SuSv2,
	  specifically, old-style numeric options ('command -1 <file>')
	  will be supported in head, tail, and fold. (Note: should
	  affect renice too.)

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_USE_PORTABLE_CODE
	bool "Avoid using GCC-specific code constructs"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_USE_PORTABLE_CODE
	help
	  Use this option if you are trying to compile busybox with
	  compiler other than gcc.
	  If you do use gcc, this option may needlessly increase code size.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PLATFORM_LINUX
	bool "Enable Linux-specific applets and features"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	  For the most part, busybox requires only POSIX compatibility
	  from the target system, but some applets and features use
	  Linux-specific interfaces.

	  Answering 'N' here will disable such applets and hide the
	  corresponding configuration options.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SHOW_USAGE
	bool "Show applet usage messages"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_SHOW_USAGE
	help
	  Enabling this option, BusyBox applets will show terse help messages
	  when invoked with wrong arguments.
	  If you do not want to show any (helpful) usage message when
	  issuing wrong command syntax, you can say 'N' here,
	  saving approximately 7k.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_VERBOSE_USAGE
	bool "Show verbose applet usage messages"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_VERBOSE_USAGE
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SHOW_USAGE
	help
	  All BusyBox applets will show verbose help messages when
	  busybox is invoked with --help. This will add a lot of text to the
	  busybox binary. In the default configuration, this will add about
	  13k, but it can add much more depending on your configuration.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_COMPRESS_USAGE
	bool "Store applet usage messages in compressed form"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_COMPRESS_USAGE
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SHOW_USAGE
	help
	  Store usage messages in .bz compressed form, uncompress them
	  on-the-fly when <applet> --help is called.

	  If you have a really tiny busybox with few applets enabled (and
	  bunzip2 isn't one of them), the overhead of the decompressor might
	  be noticeable. Also, if you run executables directly from ROM
	  and have very little memory, this might not be a win. Otherwise,
	  you probably want this.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_BUSYBOX
	bool "Include busybox applet"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_BUSYBOX
	help
	  The busybox applet provides general help regarding busybox and
	  allows the included applets to be listed.  It's also required
	  if applet links are to be installed at runtime.

	  If you can live without these features disabling this will save
	  some space.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_INSTALLER
	bool "Support --install [-s] to install applet links at runtime"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_INSTALLER
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_BUSYBOX
	help
	  Enable 'busybox --install [-s]' support. This will allow you to use
	  busybox at runtime to create hard links or symlinks for all the
	  applets that are compiled into busybox.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_INSTALL_NO_USR
	bool "Don't use /usr"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_INSTALL_NO_USR
	help
	  Disable use of /usr. busybox --install and "make install"
	  will install applets only to /bin and /sbin,
	  never to /usr/bin or /usr/sbin.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PAM
	bool "Support for PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_PAM
	help
	  Use PAM in some busybox applets (currently login and httpd) instead
	  of direct access to password database.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LONG_OPTS
	bool "Support for --long-options"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_LONG_OPTS
	help
	  Enable this if you want busybox applets to use the gnu --long-option
	  style, in addition to single character -a -b -c style options.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_DEVPTS
	bool "Use the devpts filesystem for Unix98 PTYs"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_DEVPTS
	help
	  Enable if you want BusyBox to use Unix98 PTY support. If enabled,
	  busybox will use /dev/ptmx for the master side of the pseudoterminal
	  and /dev/pts/<number> for the slave side. Otherwise, BSD style
	  /dev/ttyp<number> will be used. To use this option, you should have
	  devpts mounted.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_CLEAN_UP
	bool "Clean up all memory before exiting (usually not needed)"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_CLEAN_UP
	help
	  As a size optimization, busybox normally exits without explicitly
	  freeing dynamically allocated memory or closing files. This saves
	  space since the OS will clean up for us, but it can confuse debuggers
	  like valgrind, which report tons of memory and resource leaks.

	  Don't enable this unless you have a really good reason to clean
	  things up manually.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_UTMP
	bool "Support utmp file"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_UTMP
	help
	  The file /var/run/utmp is used to track who is currently logged in.
	  With this option on, certain applets (getty, login, telnetd etc)
	  will create and delete entries there.
	  "who" applet requires this option.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_WTMP
	bool "Support wtmp file"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_WTMP
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_UTMP
	help
	  The file /var/run/wtmp is used to track when users have logged into
	  and logged out of the system.
	  With this option on, certain applets (getty, login, telnetd etc)
	  will append new entries there.
	  "last" applet requires this option.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_PIDFILE
	bool "Support writing pidfiles"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_PIDFILE
	help
	  This option makes some applets (e.g. crond, syslogd, inetd) write
	  a pidfile at the configured PID_FILE_PATH.  It has no effect
	  on applets which require pidfiles to run.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PID_FILE_PATH
	string "Path to directory for pidfile"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_PID_FILE_PATH
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_PIDFILE
	help
	  This is the default path where pidfiles are created.  Applets which
	  allow you to set the pidfile path on the command line will override
	  this value.  The option has no effect on applets that require you to
	  specify a pidfile path.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SUID
	bool "Support for SUID/SGID handling"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SUID
	help
	  With this option you can install the busybox binary belonging
	  to root with the suid bit set, enabling some applets to perform
	  root-level operations even when run by ordinary users
	  (for example, mounting of user mounts in fstab needs this).

	  Busybox will automatically drop privileges for applets
	  that don't need root access.

	  If you are really paranoid and don't want to do this, build two
	  busybox binaries with different applets in them (and the appropriate
	  symlinks pointing to each binary), and only set the suid bit on the
	  one that needs it.

	  The applets which require root rights (need suid bit or
	  to be run by root) and will refuse to execute otherwise:
	  crontab, login, passwd, su, vlock, wall.

	  The applets which will use root rights if they have them
	  (via suid bit, or because run by root), but would try to work
	  without root right nevertheless:
	  findfs, ping[6], traceroute[6], mount.

	  Note that if you DONT select this option, but DO make busybox
	  suid root, ALL applets will run under root, which is a huge
	  security hole (think "cp /some/file /etc/passwd").

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SUID_CONFIG
	bool "Runtime SUID/SGID configuration via /etc/busybox.conf"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SUID_CONFIG
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SUID
	help
	  Allow the SUID / SGID state of an applet to be determined at runtime
	  by checking /etc/busybox.conf. (This is sort of a poor man's sudo.)
	  The format of this file is as follows:

	  APPLET = [Ssx-][Ssx-][x-] [USER.GROUP]

	  s: USER or GROUP is allowed to execute APPLET.
	     APPLET will run under USER or GROUP
	     (reagardless of who's running it).
	  S: USER or GROUP is NOT allowed to execute APPLET.
	     APPLET will run under USER or GROUP.
	     This option is not very sensical.
	  x: USER/GROUP/others are allowed to execute APPLET.
	     No UID/GID change will be done when it is run.
	  -: USER/GROUP/others are not allowed to execute APPLET.

	  An example might help:

	  [SUID]
	  su = ssx root.0 # applet su can be run by anyone and runs with
	                  # euid=0/egid=0
	  su = ssx        # exactly the same

	  mount = sx- root.disk # applet mount can be run by root and members
	                        # of group disk (but not anyone else)
	                        # and runs with euid=0 (egid is not changed)

	  cp = --- # disable applet cp for everyone

	  The file has to be owned by user root, group root and has to be
	  writeable only by root:
	        (chown 0.0 /etc/busybox.conf; chmod 600 /etc/busybox.conf)
	  The busybox executable has to be owned by user root, group
	  root and has to be setuid root for this to work:
	        (chown 0.0 /bin/busybox; chmod 4755 /bin/busybox)

	  /etc/busybox.conf should be readable by the user needing the SUID,

	  permissions.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_SELINUX
	bool "Support NSA Security Enhanced Linux"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_SELINUX
	select BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PLATFORM_LINUX
	help
	  Enable support for SELinux in applets ls, ps, and id. Also provide
	  the option of compiling in SELinux applets.

	  If you do not have a complete SELinux userland installed, this stuff
	  will not compile.  Specifially, libselinux 1.28 or better is
	  directly required by busybox. If the installation is located in a
	  non-standard directory, provide it by invoking make as follows:
		CFLAGS=-I<libselinux-include-path> \
		LDFLAGS=-L<libselinux-lib-path> \
		make

	  Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_PREFER_APPLETS
	bool "exec prefers applets"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_PREFER_APPLETS
	help
	  This is an experimental option which directs applets about to
	  call 'exec' to try and find an applicable busybox applet before
	  searching the PATH. This is typically done by exec'ing
	  /proc/self/exe.
	  This may affect shell, find -exec, xargs and similar applets.
	  They will use applets even if /bin/<applet> -> busybox link
	  is missing (or is not a link to busybox). However, this causes
	  problems in chroot jails without mounted /proc and with ps/top
	  (command name can be shown as 'exe' for applets started this way).

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_BUSYBOX_EXEC_PATH
	string "Path to BusyBox executable"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_BUSYBOX_EXEC_PATH
	help
	  When Busybox applets need to run other busybox applets, BusyBox
	  sometimes needs to exec() itself. When the /proc filesystem is
	  mounted, /proc/self/exe always points to the currently running
	  executable. If you haven't got /proc, set this to wherever you
	  want to run BusyBox from.

# These are auto-selected by other options

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_SYSLOG
	bool #No description makes it a hidden option
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SYSLOG

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_STATIC

	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_STATIC
	help
	  If you want to build a static BusyBox binary, which does not
	  use or require any shared libraries, then enable this option.
	  This can cause BusyBox to be considerably larger, so you should
	  leave this option false unless you have a good reason (i.e.
	  your target platform does not support shared libraries, or
	  you are building an initrd which doesn't need anything but
	  BusyBox, etc).

	  Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PIE
	bool "Build BusyBox as a position independent executable"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_PIE

	help
	  Hardened code option. PIE binaries are loaded at a different

	  particularly on x86-32 which is short on registers.

	  Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_NOMMU
	bool "Force NOMMU build"
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_NOMMU
	help
	  Busybox tries to detect whether architecture it is being
	  built against supports MMU or not. If this detection fails,
	  or if you want to build NOMMU version of busybox for testing,
	  you may force NOMMU build here.

	  Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_BUILD_LIBBUSYBOX
	depends on !BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_PREFER_APPLETS && !BUSYBOX_CONFIG_PIE && !BUSYBOX_CONFIG_STATIC
	help
	  Build a shared library libbusybox.so.N.N.N which contains all
	  busybox code.

	  This feature allows every applet to be built as a tiny
	  separate executable. Enabling it for "one big busybox binary"
	  approach serves no purpose and increases code size.
	  You should almost certainly say "no" to this.

### config FEATURE_FULL_LIBBUSYBOX
###	bool "Feature-complete libbusybox"
###	default n if !FEATURE_SHARED_BUSYBOX
###	depends on BUILD_LIBBUSYBOX
###	help
###	  Build a libbusybox with the complete feature-set, disregarding
###	  the actually selected config.
###
###	  Normally, libbusybox will only contain the features which are
###	  used by busybox itself. If you plan to write a separate
###	  standalone application which uses libbusybox say 'Y'.
###
###	  Note: libbusybox is GPL, not LGPL, and exports no stable API that
###	  might act as a copyright barrier. We can and will modify the
###	  exported function set between releases (even minor version number
###	  changes), and happily break out-of-tree features.
###
###	  Say 'N' if in doubt.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_INDIVIDUAL
	bool "Produce a binary for each applet, linked against libbusybox"

	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_BUILD_LIBBUSYBOX
	help
	  If your CPU architecture doesn't allow for sharing text/rodata
	  sections of running binaries, but allows for runtime dynamic
	  libraries, this option will allow you to reduce memory footprint
	  when you have many different applets running at once.

	  If your CPU architecture allows for sharing text/rodata,
	  having single binary is more optimal.

	  Each applet will be a tiny program, dynamically linked
	  against libbusybox.so.N.N.N.

	  You need to have a working dynamic linker.

### config BUILD_AT_ONCE
###	bool "Compile all sources at once"
###	default n
###	help
###	  Normally each source-file is compiled with one invocation of
###	  the compiler.
###	  If you set this option, all sources are compiled at once.
###	  This gives the compiler more opportunities to optimize which can
###	  result in smaller and/or faster binaries.
###
###	  Setting this option will consume alot of memory, e.g. if you
###	  enable all applets with all features, gcc uses more than 300MB
###	  RAM during compilation of busybox.
###
###	  This option is most likely only beneficial for newer compilers
###	  such as gcc-4.1 and above.
###
###	  Say 'N' unless you know what you are doing.

config BUSYBOX_CONFIG_LFS
	bool
	default BUSYBOX_DEFAULT_LFS
	help
	  If you want to build BusyBox with large file support, then enable
	  this option. This will have no effect if your kernel or your C
	  library lacks large file support for large files. Some of the
	  programs that can benefit from large file support include dd, gzip,
	  cp, mount, tar, and many others. If you want to access files larger

	  dmalloc support:
	  ----------------
	  This enables compiling with dmalloc ( http://dmalloc.com/ )
	  which is an excellent public domain mem leak and malloc problem
	  detector. To enable dmalloc, before running busybox you will
	  want to properly set your environment, for example:
	    export DMALLOC_OPTIONS=debug=0x34f47d83,inter=100,log=logfile
	  The 'debug=' value is generated using the following command

	  -----------------------
	  This enables compiling with Electric-fence support. Electric
	  fence is another very useful malloc debugging library which uses
	  your computer's virtual memory hardware to detect illegal memory
	  accesses. This support will make BusyBox be considerable larger
	  and run slower, so you should leave this option disabled unless
	  you are hunting a hard to find memory problem.
