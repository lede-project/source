Subject: [PATCH] ath10k: activate user space firmware loading again

In commit 9f5bcfe93315 ("ath10k: silence firmware file probing
warnings") the firmware loading was changed from request_firmware() to
request_firmware_direct() to silence some warnings in case it fails.
request_firmware_direct() directly searches in the file system only and
does not send a hotplug event to user space in case it could not find
the firmware directly.
In LEDE we use a user space script to extract the calibration data from
the flash memory which gets triggered by the hotplug event. This way the
firmware gets extracted from some vendor specific partition when the
driver requests this firmware. This mechanism does not work any more
after this change.
