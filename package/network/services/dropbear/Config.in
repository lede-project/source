config DROPBEAR_CURVE25519
	bool "Curve25519 support"
	default y
	help
		This enables the following key exchange algorithm:
		  curve25519-sha256@libssh.org

		Increases binary size by about 13 kB uncompressed (MIPS).

config DROPBEAR_ECC
	bool "Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)"
	default n
	help
		Enables elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) support in key exchange and public key
		authentication.

		Key exchange algorithms:
		  ecdh-sha2-nistp256
		  ecdh-sha2-nistp384
		  ecdh-sha2-nistp521

		Public key algorithms:
		  ecdsa-sha2-nistp256
		  ecdsa-sha2-nistp384
		  ecdsa-sha2-nistp521

		Does not generate ECC host keys by default (ECC key exchange will not be used,
		only ECC public key auth).

		Increases binary size by about 23 kB (MIPS).

config DROPBEAR_ZLIB
	bool "Enable compression"
	default n
	help
		Enables compression using shared zlib library.

		Increases binary size by about 0.1 kB (MIPS) and requires additional 62 kB (MIPS)
		for a shared zlib library.

config DROPBEAR_UTMP
	bool "Utmp support"
	default n
	depends on BUSYBOX_CONFIG_FEATURE_UTMP
	help
		This enables dropbear utmp support, the file /var/run/utmp is used to
		track who is currently logged in.

config DROPBEAR_PUTUTLINE
	bool "Pututline support"
	default n
	depends on DROPBEAR_UTMP
	help
		Dropbear will use pututline() to write the utmp structure into the utmp file.
