Version 1.05
	* OpenSSH version 5.6 closed our leaked slave PTY fd, breaking sshpass.
	  This reverted the "better detection of child exit", unfortunately.
	* Update the manual page about changes.
	* Print usage information if no arguments given.

Version 1.04
	* Fix crash when "-e" is given but environment variable is not set -
	  based on patch suggested by Samuel Rios Carvalho.
	* Fix 100% CPU usage during session. Reported by anonymous on the
	  SourceForge bug tracking system.
	* Attempt to hide a password provided on the command line. It does
	  expose the password length. Base on a patch by anonymous from the
	  sourceforge bug tracking system.

Version 1.03
	* Sshpass will now exit if ssh is asking to confirm a host key
	* Sshpass now has verbose reporting of what error occured through the
	  program's return codes.

Version 1.02
	* Various updates to the tests done by the configure script
	* Broader platform support (cygwin)

Version 1.01
	* Make sshpass pass along tty window resize events to the inner tty

Version 1.00
	* Make sure that authentication failures are terminated early.
	* Better detect when the child has exited.
	* Improve error reporting.

Version 0.03
	* Change the match string from "Password: " to "assword:", as some ssh
	  usage uses a different prompt ("foo@bar's password:" instead of a
	  clean "Password:").
	* Add the "-V" option to display the version information

Version 0.02
	* Add the "-e" option.
