sshpass was written by Shachar Shemesh for Lingnu Open Source Consulting Ltd.

It is distributed under the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public
License version 2. Upgrade to later versions of the GPL can be done under the
normal terms of the GPL *only if said version of the GPL was approved by Lingnu
Open Source Consulting Ltd. as a valid license for its projects*.

We are sorry that we have to impose this extra burecratic step, but it seems
that the GPL v. 3 is still some way off, and it is likely that we would not
like our code used under the resulting license. Rather than prohibit license
upgrades altogether, we decided to allow it in principle, pending explicit
approval by us.
